Please first see the bazel BUILD all, enven including kissfft.
especiallly kissfft/BUILD.bazel.

 20     copts = [
 21         "-DFIXED_POINT=16",
 22     ],

After using bazel build bazel_xxx directory will be generated which including kissfft download by bazel build.

How to indicate the "-DFIXED_POINT=16" by cmakefile ?

add_definitions("-DFIXED_POINT=16")

which mean that:
   74 #ifdef FIXED_POINT
   75  
   76 #if (FIXED_POINT == 16)
   77   printf("check the meaning of add_definitions\n");
   78 #endif
   79  
   80 #endif

if not "-DFIXED_POINT=16", the result is very seriously wrong.

the audio feature used for trainning not align with reference.

// abosulte directory can be used.
